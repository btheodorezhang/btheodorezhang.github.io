# **Mini-Workshop: Source Models of Galactic Cosmic Rays**
-->

![Cosmic Ray Workshop Banner](https://btheodorezhang.github.io/files/cosmic_ray_path.png)
Cosmic rays are high-energy particles moving as speed of light. Detailed differences in their abundances can tell us about cosmic ray sources and their trip through the galaxy.

Join us for an engaging **mini-workshop** exploring the origin and propagation of **Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs)**. This event will bring together experts and researchers to discuss observational constraints, theoretical models, and open questions in the field.
