My name is Bing Theodore Zhang (张兵). I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University.

Research interests
======

My research interests lie at the intersection of high-energy astrophysics and particle physics, especially on the origin and propagation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), high-energy neutrinos, and high-energy gamma-rays, as well as related topics about the high energy astrophysical phenomenen in the universe. 

# What is the origin of UHECRs detected by Pierre Auger observatory and Telescope Array?
  ### Background: Cosmic rays with energy larger than 1 EeV are referred to as UHECRs, and their origin is a long-standing unresolved problem in astroparticle physics. Recent data sets from the Auger observatory and Telescope Array have shown that the primary mass of UHECRs is dominated by a light composition at an energy of around 2 EeV, and then becomes gradually heavier with increasing energy up to 40 EeV. The mass composition of UHECR nuclei is crucial for us to test the theories concerning the origin of UHECRs.
  ### Results: 
        Tidal disruption events (TDEs): Our predictions show that UHECR nuclei can be produced and survive at external reverse shock, forward shock, and disk winds for Swift J1644+57 jetted-like TDEs. We find that the tidal disruption of main sequence stars or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs does not successfully reproduce UHECR observations, but oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs can give a better explanation to observations even though they are rare. (1706.00391, lead author)
	Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): We demonstrate low-luminosity GRBs can act as the sources of UHECRs and give new predictions based on the intrajet nuclear composition models considering progenitor dependencies. (1712.09984, lead author)
        Engine-driven supernova: We show that engine-driven supernova can explain the observed UHECR spectrum in the external reverse shock scenario if their local rate is ~1 percent of core-collapse supernova rate. (1812.10289, lead author)
        Energetics of UHECR nuclei: We find the resulting UHECR energy generation rate density to be ~ (0.2 - 2) * 1E44 erg per cubic mega-parsec per year with a nontrivial dependence on the spectral index. (2012.03122, second main co-author)
	Radio galaxy: We found that the UHECR spectrum and composition can be reasonable explained with shear reacceleration mechanism assuming a certain fraction of galactic cosmic rays in a halo is entrained. (1705.05027, third co-author)

I am a member of [The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND)](https://grand.cnrs.fr). I am working for the GRAND300 project on the design of a conventional ground array (i.e., array of water-Cherenkov detectors) for hybrid detection of the extensive air showers.

## The origin of UHECR nuclei from Low-luminosity Gamma-ray bursts ([arXiV: 1712.09984](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09984))

We suggest that the low-luminosity (LL) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be the sources of UHECR nuclei. LL GRBs are a subclass of GRBs which have lower luminosity ($L_\gamma \leq 10^{49}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$) and higher event rate ($\sim 300 \rm~Gpc~yr^{-1}$) compared to the classical high-luminosity (HL) GRBs. 
As have been shown in the left panel of the figure, the nuclear component in the interior of the progenitors can be loaded into the relativistic outflow.
We found that the intrajet nuclear component can be divided into two groups depending on the mass fraction of Silicon nuclei, Si-free and Si-rich. In addition, we also consider the hypernova ejecta composition under the case that the jet maybe launched later than the hypernova. 
We found the Si-rich model or hypernova ejecta model can match the Auger data well, while the Si-free models have more difficulty in fitting the spectrum, as we have shown in the right panel of the figure for nuclear composition model Si-R 2.
