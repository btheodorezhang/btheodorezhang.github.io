## What is the origin of UHECRs detected by Pierre Auger observatory and Telescope Array?

### Background

Cosmic rays with energy larger than 1 EeV are referred to as UHECRs, and their origin is a long-standing unresolved problem in astroparticle physics. Recent data sets from the Auger observatory and Telescope Array have shown that the primary mass of UHECRs is dominated by a light composition at an energy of around 2 EeV, and then becomes gradually heavier with increasing energy up to 40 EeV. The mass composition of UHECR nuclei is crucial for us to test the theories concerning the origin of UHECRs.

### Results 

**Tidal disruption events (TDEs)**: Our predictions show that UHECR nuclei can be produced and survive at external reverse shock, forward shock, and disk winds for Swift J1644+57 jetted-like TDEs. We find that the tidal disruption of main sequence stars or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs does not successfully reproduce UHECR observations, but oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs can give a better explanation to observations even though they are rare. (*1706.00391, lead author*)

**Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)**: We demonstrate low-luminosity GRBs can act as the sources of UHECRs and give new predictions based on the intrajet nuclear composition models considering progenitor dependencies. (*1712.09984, lead author*)

**Engine-driven supernova**: We show that engine-driven supernova can explain the observed UHECR spectrum in the external reverse shock scenario if their local rate is ~1 percent of core-collapse supernova rate.(*1812.10289, lead author*)

**Energetics of UHECR nuclei**: We find the resulting UHECR energy generation rate density to be ~ (0.2 - 2) * 1E44 erg per cubic mega-parsec per year with a nontrivial dependence on the spectral index. (*2012.03122, second main co-author*)

**Radio galaxy**: We found that the UHECR spectrum and composition can be reasonable explained with shear reacceleration mechanism assuming a certain fraction of galactic cosmic rays in a halo is entrained. (*1705.05027, third co-author*)

## What is the origin of high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube observatory?

### Background

The IceCube Collaboration reported the first detection of an ~3.5 sigma excess of ~13 neutrino events in the direction of the blazar TXS0506+56 during an ~6 months period in 2014-2015, as well as the ~3 sigma detection of a high-energy (> 290 TeV) muon-track neutrino during an electromagnetic flare in 2017. On 2019 October, the IceCube Collaboration reported the detection of another ~200 TeV muon neutrino which may originated from tidal disruption event (TDE), AT2019dsg.

### Results

**IceCube170922A - TXS 0506+57**: We demonstrate that the neutral beam model provides an explanation for the 2014-2015 neutrino excess without violating X-ray and gamma-ray constraints and yields results consistent with the detection of one high-energy neutrino during the 2017 flare. (*1910.11464, lead author*)

**IceCube191001A – AT2019dsg**: We found that the most optimistic cases of the corona and hidden wind models could be consistent with the observation of IceCube-191001A. (*2005.08937, third main co-author*)

**IceCube200530A – AT2019fdr**: We showed that the expected number of neutrinos from sub-relativistic wind is lower than what have been observed, and higher cosmic ray luminosity are required. (*2111.09390, one of the authors*)

**Blazars as the sources of PeV neutrinos**: We found that the cumulative PeV neutrino flux contributed by all-sky blazars is a fraction < (10% ~ 50%) of the IceCube detected flux. (*1607.02211, lead author*)

## What is the origin of very-high-energy gamma-rays detected by H.E.S.S.? 

### Background

The MAGIC and H.E.S.S. collaboration have reported the detection of TeV photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), GRB 190114C and GRB 180720B. Recently, H.E.S.S. reported the detection of TeV emission from a nearby low-luminosity GRB 190829A. In addition, the MAGIC collaboration also reported a ~3 sigma detection of TeV photons from short GRB 160821B.

### Results

**GRB 190829A – H.E.S.S.**: We show that the TeV photons during the H.E.S.S. observation time is naturally produced in the external inverse-Compton scenario, where seed photons supplied by the flares or other late-time dissipations. (*2012.07796, lead author*)

**GRB 160821B – MAGIC**: We found that the up-scattering of the extended and plateau emission from activities of a long-lasting central engine by forward shock high-energy electrons is consistent with the MAGIC observations. (*2012.09143, lead author*)

## Numerical code for calculating the high-energy emissions from various astrophysical sources.

### Background

With the beginning of the new era of multi-messenger particle astrophysics, we may have chance to detect gravitational waves, electromagnetic radiation from radio to TeV band, high-energy neutrinos, and even UHECRs from astrophysical high-energy sources simultaneously. 

### Results

We developed numerical code to calculate non-thermal emissions from GRBs and other astrophysical environments, which aimed to be publicly available in the near future after including the hadronic processes. (*2012.07796, lead author*)

## How can we detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos with water Cherenkov detector array and radio antennas?

### Background

The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a planned large-scale observatory of UHE cosmic rays and neutrinos.

### Results

I take an active part in the design of a conventional ground array for hybrid detection of the extensive air showers for GRANDProto300 with detectors deployed over 300 km^2. (*1810.09994, one of the collaborators*)

## The origin of UHECR nuclei from Low-luminosity Gamma-ray bursts ([arXiV: 1712.09984](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09984))

<!--
We suggest that the low-luminosity (LL) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be the sources of UHECR nuclei. LL GRBs are a subclass of GRBs which have lower luminosity ($L_\gamma \leq 10^{49}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$) and higher event rate ($\sim 300 \rm~Gpc~yr^{-1}$) compared to the classical high-luminosity (HL) GRBs. 
As have been shown in the left panel of the figure, the nuclear component in the interior of the progenitors can be loaded into the relativistic outflow.
We found that the intrajet nuclear component can be divided into two groups depending on the mass fraction of Silicon nuclei, Si-free and Si-rich. In addition, we also consider the hypernova ejecta composition under the case that the jet maybe launched later than the hypernova. 
We found the Si-rich model or hypernova ejecta model can match the Auger data well, while the Si-free models have more difficulty in fitting the spectrum, as we have shown in the right panel of the figure for nuclear composition model Si-R 2.
